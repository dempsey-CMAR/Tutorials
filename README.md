# Tutorials

These tutorials are a useful introduction to the R programming language
and many of its packages; by doing them, one can learn about R basics,
importing data, plotting, the dplyr package, mapping, iteration,
functions, dashboards, and more. The tutorials were originally developed
to help employees of the Centre for Marine Applied Research (CMAR) with
varying levels of R coding experience learn more R techniques.

To do the tutorials, download this repository to your own computer by
clicking the green “Code” button and choosing “Download ZIP” (Figure 1).
Once you have extracted all the files to the location of your choice on
your computer, click the “Tutorials.Rproj” file to open the project
(Figure 2). Each tutorial folder contains all the code files and data
needed to do that tutorial. To make sure the file paths in the tutorials
are correct, always do the tutorials with the project open, and do not
remove the tutorial folders from your local repository.

If you have any questions or concerns about the code, you may create a
new issue on GitHub.
